# KiwiTech Internal Portal Prototype

This repository is used to learn the fundamentals of **version control**, **GitHub**, and the foundations of **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment).

The goal is to understand how modern development teams safely store, update, and deploy applications.

## What We Are Practising

* Uploading code to a GitHub repository
* Tracking changes through commits
* Creating and merging branches
* Pulling and pushing updates
* Preparing a project for future CI/CD automation

## Why This Matters

GitHub provides a central place to store and manage code so that:
* No work is lost
* Every update is recorded
* Teams can collaborate safely
* Mistakes can be undone easily
* New features can be added without breaking the main project

## How CI/CD Fits In

CI/CD is the process of:
* Automatically testing changes (CI)
* Automatically deploying updated applications (CD)

By the end of this project, this repository will be connected to a simple CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys the webpage whenever new changes are pushed.

## In Simple Terms

This repo is where we practise:
* Saving our work properly
* Working on new features safely
* Combining changes smoothly
* Preparing code for automatic deployment

Everything here is about building confidence with GitHub and learning how real development teams release updates quickly and reliably.
